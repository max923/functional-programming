## Thinking in functional terms

 ####### OOP: OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts
 ####### FP: FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.

 **Thinking about an application’s design, ask yourself the following questions in terms of these design principles**

 * Extensibility— Do I constantly refactor my code to support additional functionality?
 * Easy to modularize— If I change one file, is another file affected?
 * Reusability— Is there a lot of duplication?
 * Testability— Do I struggle to unit test my functions?
 * Easy to reason about— Is my code unstructured and hard to follow?
